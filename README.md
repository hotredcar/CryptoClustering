# CryptoClusteringProject 3

In this challenge, we used Python and 'Unsupervised Learning' to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Data Sources:

[crypto_market_data.csv] 

## File List:

[Crypto_Clustering_code] - Python for Data Extraction, Manipulation and Analysis


## Conclusion:

In conclusion, using fewer features through dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA can be beneficial for clustering tasks by simplifying the data representation and potentially improving computational efficiency. However, it's essential to carefully balance the trade-off between dimensionality reduction and preserving sufficient information for accurate clustering. Additionally, the choice of the number of clusters remains crucial, and it should be based on both quantitative methods like the elbow curve and qualitative assessment of clustering results.
