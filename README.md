# CryptoClustering

In this challenge, we used Python and 'Unsupervised Learning' to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Conclusion:

In this challenge, we did use Python and unsupervised learning techniques like K-means clustering to analyze cryptocurrency data. However, the specific task of predicting if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes wasn't explicitly mentioned or addressed in the interactions we had. Instead, we focused on tasks such as data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction using PCA, clustering using K-means, and visualizing clustering results.

While K-means clustering can be used for various tasks, such as identifying patterns or grouping similar data points together, it's important to note that it's primarily an exploratory technique and not typically used for prediction tasks like regression or classification.

To predict the impact of 24-hour or 7-day price changes on cryptocurrencies, we would typically employ supervised learning algorithms like regression or classification, where we have labeled data indicating whether the price change had an effect or not. These algorithms learn patterns from historical data and then make predictions on new, unseen data.

So, in summary, while we used Python and unsupervised learning techniques in this challenge, we didn't specifically address the task of predicting the impact of price changes on cryptocurrencies.
